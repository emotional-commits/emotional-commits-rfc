# Q&A

**Is this a joke?**
No. But if you found it funny I am glad my time was not wasted.

**`whoami`**
I am 20 something years old software engineer, graduate of Web and software engineering at [FIT CTU](https://fit.cvut.cz/en), currently working as a backend Typescript/Node.js developer. I am a git enthusiast and recently a Gitmoji co-maintainer.

**Isn't it unfortunate that Git itself does not follow any of the guidelines, except the first one?**
It is. That is the reason why I despised conventions that deviated from the default style.
I am not fond of the idea, but I believe that the benefits overweight this (somewhat cosmetic) issue many times over.

**Do you think that generated semver/changelog is a good idea?**
It's not the greatest idea, but it's good enough.
Managing semver and changelog manually is hard. If your project has so well refined process, tooling and chain of responsibility that you manage to do all by yourself, good. You should keep doing that.
But the process is so complex that small teams or individuals struggle to do so.
For those cases generated version management (or just changelog) is better alternative to giving up and have no such features in their projects.

If machine readability is advanced enough, we can integrate human aspects into the process, making the changelog management just about revisions.
