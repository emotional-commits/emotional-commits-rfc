# Emotional commits

[![emotional-commits](./rfc/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emotional-commits/emotional-commits-rfc)

Emotional commits is a specification proposal for commit message and annotation format convention in Git.

</div>

## About

Emotional commits are heavily inspired by best practices based on Git generated commits, which are well summarized in [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and two existing standards: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me).

The specification defines and gives recommendations for the structure of commit messages, including text format and metadata. The specification uses emoticons to categorize revisions, which provides an easy graphical aid to help non author developers to understand the purpose of the revision.

## The specification

Based on the research summarized in [motivation](./docs/motivation.md) I created a [RFC](./rfc/README.md) draft.

Haver some questions? I tried to answer a few in [Q&A](./docs/qa.md).

The project is at very early draft stage. Your attention and opinions are the most valuable help you can provide at the moment.
